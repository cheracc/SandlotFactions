SandlotFactions
===============

A custom plugin to modify behavior on the Sandlot's Factions server.

What it does:

Adds "tokens" that are awarded hourly and dropped on PvP death.
Adds "armor effects" - potion effects granted by wearing certain sets or pieces of armor.
Adds a cooldown to switching factions (joining or leaving results in 1 hour cooldown)
Saves times of last player death and last faction change to persist through restarts.
